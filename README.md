Dota 2 custom map. Genre is mob arena. I use typescript template - https://github.com/ModDota/TypeScriptAddonTemplate


The guide uses variables from the barebone addon " (npc.IsRealHero() && npc.bFirstSpawned == undefined) " but i have error. Install Barebone and still doesn't work.

My plan
-hide map ->create map
-сreate 3-5 defenders hero
-create a mechanic for waves of monsters
-create a mechanic for selecting an item after a wave
-create melee and ranged monster
-create boss
